  <h1>History of KGMU</h1>
 </div>
       <p class="MyClass"> King George V, then the Prince of Wales, laid the foundation stone of King George's Medical College in 1906. The College opened its gates in 1911, though the official opening ceremony was delayed to January 1912. The College was directly under the Government of the United Provinces, and degrees were awarded through Allahabad University. In 1921, the College was transferred to Lucknow University.

In 2002 the Government of Uttar Pradesh, led by Mayawati of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), granted university status the college and renamed it Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University (CSMMU), under the Uttar Pradesh Chhatrapati Shahuji Medical University Act, 2002.In August 2003 Mulayam Singh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP) replaced Mayawati and became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Two months later, in October 2003, the name of the University was changed to King George's Medical University (KGMU) by the Uttar Pradesh Chhartrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University (Second Amendment) Act, 2003.

Name-changing continued. In 2007, after the BSP won the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election and Mayawati returned to office, the name of the institution reverted to CSMMU. When control returned to the SP in the 2012 election, Akhilesh Yadav's government returned the name of the University the current "King George Medical University".</p>
